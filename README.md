Boolean Exercise

## Process

I am still learning HTML & CSS. To truly understand not just how to code, but UI and importance of a well-designed application that doesn't just look good, but it's written well I decided to not rush into writing the code immediately. 
I made a checklist of ***steps*** to follow to have an organized and scalable development of this mock-up project.  

**STEPS**  
1. Analysis of the assignment 
2. Documentation
3. Wireframe
4. Figma Mock-up
5. Essential HTML based on the mock-up
6. Essential CSS
7. Implementating Responsiveness in CSS
8. Experiment animations and transitions in Figma
9. Apply animations and transitions in CSS
10. Complete Documentation
